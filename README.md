This is a simple Form Builder web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file provides the structure of the app, including buttons to add different types of form fields and an area where the form is generated dynamically. The CSS file (formbuilder.css) is used to style the layout, buttons, and form elements, making the interface clean and easy to use. The JavaScript file (formbuilder.js) adds functionality by allowing users to dynamically add text fields, email fields, and text areas to the form based on button clicks. This project demonstrates basic front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic form creation in a simple and practical way.
